## Explanation of the Approach

1. **Problem Restatement**  
    We have an even-sized array `nums` (size `n`). We want to split these `n` elements into two subsets, each of size `n/2`, such that the absolute difference of their sums is minimized. Symbolically:
    
    minimize ∣∑(subset)−∑(remaining elements)∣\text{minimize } \Bigl| \sum(\text{subset}) - \sum(\text{remaining elements}) \Bigr|
    
    Since the total sum is sum=∑i=1nnums[i]\text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{nums}[i], we want to minimize ∣sum−2⋅X∣\bigl|\text{sum} - 2 \cdot X\bigr|, where XX is the sum of the chosen n2\tfrac{n}{2} elements.
    
2. **Meet in the Middle Concept**
    
    - We split the array into two halves:
        - **Left half**: indices `[0..(n/2 - 1)]`
        - **Right half**: indices `[n/2..(n-1)]`
    - Each half has n2\tfrac{n}{2} elements.
    - We will generate **all possible subsets** of each half and store:
        - The sum of elements chosen from the left half
        - The sum of elements chosen from the right half
    - Additionally, we group these sums by the **number of elements** chosen in that subset (popcount or subset size).
3. **Generating All Possible Subset Sums**
    
    - For each bitmask `i` from `0` to `(1<<n_half) - 1`:
        - If bit `on` in `i` is set, it means “include the `on`-th element” in that subset.
        - We sum up the corresponding values from the left half (`sum1`) and from the right half (`sum2`).
        - We record `sum1` in `left[popcount(i)]` and `sum2` in `right[popcount(i)]`.
    - After this, for each possible subset size `k` from `0` to `n/2`, `left[k]` contains all sums of exactly `k` elements from the left half, and `right[k]` contains all sums of exactly `k` elements from the right half.
4. **Pairing Subsets to Get Exactly `n/2` Elements**  
    If we pick `sz` elements from the left subset, we must pick `n/2 - sz` elements from the right subset so that total elements = `n/2`.
    
    - Hence, for each `sz` in `[0..n/2]`, we pair each sum `a` in `left[sz]` with each sum `b` in `right[n/2 - sz]`.
    - We want to minimize ∣sum−2⋅(a+b)∣|\text{sum} - 2 \cdot (a + b)|.
    - To do this efficiently, we sort each `right[sz]` vector, then do a binary search for the best candidate around sum2−a\frac{\text{sum}}{2} - a. Checking the closest one or two elements in that sorted array yields the minimal difference.
5. **Why It Works**
    
    - By enumerating all subsets of each half separately, we have 2n/22^{n/2} possibilities per half (rather than 2n2^n if we tried to brute force the whole array). Since n/2=n2n/2 = \tfrac{n}{2}, the complexity is roughly O(2n/2⋅log⁡(2n/2))=O(n⋅2n/2)O(2^{n/2} \cdot \log(2^{n/2})) = O(n \cdot 2^{n/2}), which is much more feasible than O(2n)O(2^n) for large nn.
    - For each subset size `sz` in the left half, we only pair it with subsets of size `n/2 - sz` in the right half, guaranteeing that combined they form exactly n2\tfrac{n}{2} elements.
    - The minimal expression ∣sum−2(a+b)∣\bigl| \text{sum} - 2(a+b) \bigr| is the standard partition difference.
6. **Time Complexity**
    
    - Generating all subset sums for each half: 2n/22^{n/2}.
    - Sorting each of the `n/2+1` arrays `right[k]`: each has at most (n/2k)\binom{n/2}{k} sums, but overall it does not exceed O(2n/2log⁡(2n/2))O(2^{n/2} \log(2^{n/2})).
    - For each size `sz`, for each sum in `left[sz]`, we do a binary search in `right[n/2 - sz]` which is O(log⁡(2n/2))O(\log(2^{n/2})).
    - Overall meets typical O(n⋅2n/2)O(n \cdot 2^{n/2})-style complexity for meet-in-the-middle solutions.
7. **Correctness**
    
    - Each subset of size `n/2` in the original array can be uniquely formed by choosing `sz` elements in the left half and `n/2 - sz` in the right half.
    - We search for the best sum pair `(a, b)` among these partitions so that `|sum - 2*(a+b)|` is minimized.
    - By enumerating all possibilities in a structured way, we ensure that no valid partition is missed.

**Key Takeaways**

- **Meet in the middle** reduces a 2n2^n brute force down to 2n/22^{n/2} by splitting the problem into two halves.
- **Popcount** (the number of set bits) is used to track exactly how many elements were chosen from that half.
- Sorting and binary searching the partial sums from the second half is the crucial optimization step to quickly find the best complementary sum that pairs with a chosen sum from the first half.

This yields an optimal solution for the “partition array into two subsets each of size n/2n/2” with minimal sum difference.

        //    So we pair each sum 'a' in left[sz] with a sum from right[half - sz].

            int s1 = sz, s2 = half - sz;

            // left[s1] are all sums of size s1 from the left half.
